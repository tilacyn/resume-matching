From this intimate encounter <BR>with God that night, I saught to believe <BR>in and follow into a deep intimate <BR>relationship with <BR><BR>Him; thus enabling me to mature in my <BR>faith and to seek Him through all of my <BR>lifes great events. Through His healing <BR>hand I was able <BR><BR>to conquer my depression and speak out <BR>about what God was doing in my life to <BR>the rest of my youth group. From this <BR>moment, God placed <BR><BR>the calling of youth ministry in my life <BR>and I have been following his guidance <BR>ever since. It is from this calling that <BR>my passion <BR><BR>grew for the youth and that has driven <BR>me through college and through my <BR>masters, each illuminating a new piece <BR>of this calling he <BR><BR>placed on me. <BR><BR><BR><BR>Ministry Statement<BR><BR>I desire to teach the youth about why <BR>they were created, who created them, and <BR>how that loving act continues in their <BR>life and in the <BR><BR>world. I want them to understand who the <BR>Trinity is and why God created His <BR>creation. I want them to understand the <BR>fall and the <BR><BR>beginning of sin and how that still <BR>plays in their life. I want them to <BR>understand how God, in His love and <BR>sacrifice, was able to <BR><BR>reconcile his creation back into a <BR>relationship with him and, in Jesus <BR>sacrifice, crucifixion, and <BR>resurrection, they are now able to <BR><BR>have an intimate relationship with Him. <BR>I want them to be encountered by God <BR>everyday and be encouraged to spread the <BR>news of the <BR><BR>Gospel to everyone in their lives. I <BR>want them to be able to see their lives <BR>through the lens of their faith and have <BR>a dynamic <BR><BR>relationship with God that continues to <BR>transform and renew them and everyone <BR>they encounter in the world. In <BR>addition, I would desire <BR><BR>to add into the ministry is a practical <BR>artistic methodology of their faith that <BR>build on theological principles and <BR>challenges each <BR><BR>student to delve deeper into their own <BR>relationship with God. I desire to add <BR>art into the curriculm so they can begin <BR>to create a <BR><BR>piece that they will create on their own <BR>that will be a symbol that they can look <BR>throughout their journey. This pieces <BR>will be <BR><BR>designed to help teach students simple <BR>artistic practices that will enable them <BR>to create meaningful artwork based off <BR>the lessons that <BR><BR>are being taught  that they can begin to <BR>share with the rest of the group and be <BR>encouraged to dialogue with the group <BR>about what they <BR><BR>have created and what impact it has on <BR>their faith and how they see God working <BR>within themselves. Along with this goal, <BR>another aim is <BR><BR>to teach the students to understand how <BR>impactful videos and images have on <BR>their faith and was havoc it can create <BR>on their life. I <BR><BR>want them to be encouraged to create new <BR>artistic avenues, through creating new <BR>songs, artwork, or pictures, that hold <BR>true to their <BR><BR>faith rather than elements that go <BR>against and taint what they believe. <BR><BR><BR><BR>Doctrinal Belief<BR><BR>I believe in the Father, the Son, and <BR>the Holy Spirit which makes up the Holy <BR>Trintiy. Three persons existing <BR>eternally, but all equal <BR><BR>with each other. I believe in Jesus <BR>Christ is the Son of God incarnate, <BR>manifested in human flesh tempted by sin <BR>like all humans but <BR><BR>remain free from sin. I believe that the <BR>Holy Spirit is God in Spirit who guides <BR>humanity throughout our life, convicting <BR>and <BR><BR>empowering humanity to live a Christ-<BR>like life. He is the binding force that <BR>keeps us in a relationship with God. I <BR>believe that <BR><BR>humanity was created in the image of God <BR>and given rule over all the earth. Man <BR>forfeited everything when they disobeyed <BR>God. As a <BR><BR>result sin came into existence which <BR>resulted in death for all. Only through <BR>accepting Jesus as Savior and by making <BR>Him Lord of your <BR><BR>life can you spend enternity with God in <BR>heaven. I believe that salvation occurs <BR>when a person accepts Jesus Christ as <BR>Savior and God. <BR><BR>That He is the Second Adam who gave up <BR>his life voluntarily (being free from <BR>sin) for all of humanity in order for <BR>the debt to be paid <BR><BR>and so we could be reconciled back into <BR>a relationship with God and a life with <BR>him eternally. It is a salvation by <BR>grace, in that God <BR><BR>gave it freely to all who believe in <BR>Jeuss Christ his Son. I believe that the <BR>Bible is the inspired Word of God <BR>written by humanity but <BR><BR>given by God. </FONT></FONT>
