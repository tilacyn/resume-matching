As a Customer Success Manager/Technical Account Manager I have a great passion for what I do and to deliver results, my entire philosophy is based on understanding my clients goals and requirements to be successful. I take pride in becoming a subject matter expert in the products and services I deliver, but most importantly develop strategies that are inline with their objectives to help them achieve a maximum return on investment utilizing best practices. I am their advocate within the organization whether it relates to support issues, product training, or to better understand our product road map and giving them a forum to provide input for enhancements or recommendations. I also strive to provide quarterly metrics so that my clients can benchmark their own performance to identify areas that may need improvement. I place myself into the position of the client and ask what would I want or expect from me to help my business succeed.</FONT></FONT>
