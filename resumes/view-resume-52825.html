The document details outcomes of several meetings with stakeholder functions to determine the ongoing requirements for an Order Intake tool.<BR>While many of the requirements are based upon current practices for functional usage, it envisaged that HCL will recommend alternative approaches to an outcome where they identify we can make improvements using the new architecture and platform. The Developer was involved in the design and development of Java adapters that integrated the end point application with the integration hub. Users of the application are authenticated with a username and password to gain access into Order Intake Tool. Authentication is catered through LDAP to allow usage of Connection user names and passwords. This scheduled process reads the XMLfiles from the configured directory and imports the order details into Order Intake Tool Database. For the price update orders, charges details are retrieved from spreadsheet and import into Order Intake Tool database. She was involved in Unit, Integration and System and Regression testing of the application. She was also involved in developing importing the Orders through XML along with common utility functions. While parsing stores the tag values into Order class. If order Flag tag is not contains price update then inserts Order class into database. If order Flag tag contains price update value, tool fetches the excel file using order number reference in file name convention. Excel sheet contains existing and new charges with relevant details. These details are inserted into cloned Order class. Each cloned Order class is inserted into database. To send the email to all System Administrators SMTP configuration and Email Alert Configuration has to be updated by the user. Tool will send mail for successfully inserting into database.
