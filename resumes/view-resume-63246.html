		<FONT FACE="verdana, arial, geneva, sans-serif" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000f99"><b>Experience:</b><BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">WORK HISTORY<BR>Senior Technical Writer, ADARA Networks, Inc., April 2011 to July 2012 <BR>Documented deployment and operation of cloud and virtual networking servers and routers. <BR>Marketing: White papers, data sheets, position papers, sales support, partnership training material, etc.<BR>Development: Directly edited CLI (XML) code to present a consistent standard including terse and verbose descriptions. Performed QA validation of CLI code/syntax. Generated and maintained CLI Reference Guides (Perl, XML), Created user guides for apps (AIM, FSE, etc.). <BR><BR>Contract Senior Technical Writer, Cisco, November 2010 to April 2011<BR>Delivered customer documentation for Cisco server management software and hardware. This included documenting programming and administrative engineers for the following:<BR>	Unified Computing System (UCS) Manager<BR>	Virtual Network Management Center (VNMC)<BR>	Cisco Integrated Management Controller (CIMC) <BR>Produced new and updated documentation including API Reference Guides, Release Notes, Troubleshooting Guides, CLI Guides, and Faults Reference Guides.<BR><BR>Senior Technical Writer, Applied Materials, September 2002 to November 2010<BR>Delivered extensive customer documentation sets and training material for a sophisticated enterprise client/server factory management application and three fab equipment monitoring applications.<BR>Job responsibility achievements:<BR>	Always on-time, every time deadline delivery. Delivered final customer documentation sets for enterprise client/server enterprise application (7 major and 4 minor releases) and three additional related applications (6 major and 8 minor releases). Maintained 14 training courses (PowerPoint slides, instructors notes, and student handouts).<BR>	Created the complete API Reference Guide. From source code (C/C++), identified and documented the entire 2,700+ API library. Edited and improved source code comments. Created clear descriptions of in/out parameters (with examples) and wrote sample code. The expanded API availability improved customer satisfaction and reduced service calls requesting assistance in creating modeling scenarios.<BR>	Maintained proactive document quality improvement process. Documentation usability research and validation was a continuous and on-going responsibility. Users from the various target audiences were formally and informally polled on their documentation use. All comments, however casual, were subjected to a full analysis process that considered presentation, content quality, detail level, and accessibility. This generated projects of various complexities that implemented approved improvements.<BR>	Saved a multi-million dollar sale to a large Asian business. The company prepared a last-ditch 300 page implementation plan to salvage the sale with poor prospects of success. During editing, global English concepts were applied to the descriptions. All company action items were rewritten to reflect an aggressive commitment to deliver the highest level of service and quality. The strongly worded positive can-do/will-do approach was successful.<BR>	Reduced site installation time by 20 hours. Redesigned and reorganized the server and client installation guide to simplify system setup and high availability configuration (8 servers and 25 clients). Reduced document page count from 734 to 215. Eliminated the need for on-site hand-holding.<BR>	Created Immediate Doc Update service. Redefined technical publications as a service provider to information resources (SMEs, internal users, external users). All update requests and feedback, regardless of source (internal or external), were given high priority. On receipt, the update was immediately analyzed and a specific completion time/date promised. Majority of updates were completed within the same or next day. Approved updates were immediately uploaded to customer service sites.<BR>	Eliminated deadline anxieties. Convinced managers to inform SMEs that their performance was judged based on their documentation support. Negotiated with SMEs to insert documentation tasks into their project management schedule at the earliest possible date. On each date, I generated outlines which were jointly validated. Content was added/updated much earlier in the development process.<BR>	Increased writing productivity and reduced SME interaction. Developed and established standard SME relationships to improve response cycles. SMEs agreed to respond to review and validation requests within one workday and were promised no nagging. For new material, initial drafts were developed from existing documentation (however sparse). SMEs only had to provide corrective details. This eliminated most explanatory meetings.<BR>Value-added accomplishments:<BR>	Implemented global English concepts into all documentation. Review and analysis of user profiles and target audiences revealed that most new customers were based in the Asian and European markets. The utilization of global English concepts improved the user experience and immediately reduced support inquiries for clarification to near zero.<BR>	Reduced total service calls by 10%. Redesigned and repurposed context-sensitive help from a process description style to detailed step-by-step procedures. This improved operator understanding. Added new policy that all customer support requests for (how to) were handled by the tech writer instead of a support engineer. This identified areas that needed improved clarification. Over a twelve month period, how to calls were eliminated as a measurable category.<BR>	Redesigned QA test case process. Rewrote and simplified the QA test case library to allow non-engineers and lesser qualified personnel to run test cases and report variances from expected behavior. This was done by coordinating test steps with online help. Senior engineers could then focus entirely on fixing discovered bugs.<BR>	Created Instant Fix QA document update process. During QA testing, implemented a simplified process to fix documentation errors discovered during the QA testing process. Any discovered document bug was reported directly to the writer. Fixes were immediately addressed and the document checked-in  all within minutes. The tester could immediately validate the fix, resulting in reduced paperwork and follow-up tracking. This process updated documents from days to minutes instead of days.<BR>	Simplified Oracle database problem resolution. Researched and documented all Oracle database tables, entity relationships, and database program objects, providing an all-in-one data dictionary that helped the Customer Response Center more easily research database errors and problems.<BR>	Documented departmental business processes. During a hiring cycle, new contractors required extensive guidance to understand informal business processes (programming standards, resources, libraries, check-in/out procedures, etc.). Created a department process orientation document with access to a obsoleted test bed that new hires used to get up to speed. This improved start-up productivity and significantly minimized the learning curve.<BR>	Massively expanded the Knowledge Base. What was originally a thin document of about 50 simple resolution procedures was extended to incorporate major sections: component descriptions, best known methods, diagnostic processes, database details, information articles, and troubleshooting processes and procedures. This became a years-long continuously active project that applied a review process to past and current service calls to determine material to be added.<BR><BR>Owner, ARMA Services, Inc. (1990-2002)<BR>Performed short-term contracts to complete and deliver specific documentation.<BR>	Microsoft WebTV. Restructured and rewrote all call center scripts, reducing call times by 15%.<BR>	Live365.Com. Created web help for internet radio shows.<BR>	CacheVision. Documented five data sheets for customizable TV listing services.<BR>	Manage.Com. Generated online help and installation guides for server monitoring dashboards.<BR>	Loudcloud. Wrote two white papers on their robust enterprise-level internet services.<BR>	Genentech. Authored user guide for internal employee travel reporting application. <BR>Established business documentation (proposals, business plans, legal agreements, NDAs, concept propositions, and development plans) for these projects:<BR>	Java development project. <BR>	Ebook wizard-based business service.<BR>	Web-based yellow pages/catalog service.<BR>	Automated Web-site development service.<BR>	American/Chinese import/export business consortium.<BR></FONT></FONT>

This initial information demonstrates that understanding and presents my attitude and philosophy of work that I bring to the benefit of your company.<BR>An outstanding writer always keeps focus and attention on three factors of a documentation project: <BR>	Thorough knowledge of the target audience(s)<BR>	Detailed documentation plan<BR>	Efficient content collection processes<BR>Thorough Knowledge of the Target Audience(s)<BR>The real secret to writing effectively comes down to this reality  when the audience information needs are known, the creation of effective content is easy. A thorough profile of each audience is done once, with updates every two to five years. <BR>Necessary details include language comprehension, technical expertise, work environment, how, why & when a document is accessed, and preferred presentation format (words, graphics, audio, video, etc.) <BR>Detailed Documentation Planning<BR>Companies with effective documentation plans are able to start any project with a template. (Companies without plan templates need to hire me immediately.) The key features are: resources (documents, target audience profiles, SMEs, project document outlines and the all-important schedules.<BR>Efficient Content Collection Processes<BR>It is my preference to collect material as early in the development process as possible. From this a detailed outline is generated. Previous material is retained, placeholders for new material is positioned. As much as possible, initial drafts are created from internal docs and on testing machines. This reduces the need to interact with SMEs to straight-forward topic review and corrections  all done by email and without any deadline pressures on anyone.<BR>Personal Attitude<BR>I am a pleasant, self-effacing individual who is pro-actively develops and maintains clean communication lines throughout the entire group. When requested, I will fit my schedule to the availability of SMEs.<BR>My personal satisfaction is based on the absence of problems, confusions, or misunderstandings by the target audience (and within the project group). My sole personal metric is based on customer satisfaction of the documentation. <BR>I did not choose this career for the kudos - no one thinks to actually thank the writer. I take great pride in assembling words to precisely communicate the necessary information for the reader.<BR>I am an individual who loves to arrive early at work, get the coffee started, and start setting up my work day. I use a sense of humor and previously negotiated agreements to ensure smooth and painless interactions. My information collection efforts are designed for the least possible interruption of schedules.<BR>For work samples, please get the zipped CHM file at:<BR>http://www.billiardgods.com/job/<BR><BR></FONT></FONT>
