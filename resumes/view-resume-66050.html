In <BR>2009 the modeling center was actively involved <BR>with hydraulic simulations of the Drop 2 reservoir <BR>operations model located in Imperial County, <BR>California. The modeling center also offers <BR>groundwater modeling, 1-D and 2-D surface water <BR>hydrologic and hydraulic modeling, sediment <BR>transport, and many other services to public <BR>cleints serving Reclamation, the Federal <BR>Government, and local and state entities <BR>throughout the West.

The primary <BR>mission of River Operations is to deliver 9.0 maf <BR>of water to municipal, industrial, and agricultural <BR>users downstream of Hoover, Davis, and Parker <BR>Dam. <BR><BR>River Operations sets daily water schedules for <BR>Davis and Parker Dams, and sets Hoover energy, <BR>and therefore overall water releases from Hoover <BR>Dam. This requires daily and weekly planning of <BR>Lakes Mohave and Havasu within operational <BR>constraints. Daily operations require that River <BR>Operations coordinate closely with customers and <BR>stakeholders, such as the Yuma Area Office <BR>(YAO), the Central Arizona Project (CAP), the <BR>Metropolitan Water District of Southern California <BR>(MWD), the Multi Species Conservation Program <BR>(MSCP), recreational interests such as the <BR>National Park Service and marinas, the Southern <BR>Nevada Water Authority (SNWA), the Imperial <BR>Irrigation District (IID), the Western Area Power <BR>Administration (Western) and many more. <BR><BR>River Operations also performs mid-term <BR>operations forecasts through the 24-month study, <BR>a mid-term model with a monthly time step that <BR>allows stakeholders to plan future activities. <BR>Forecasting for the Colorado River involved 12% <BR>on the Continental United States watershed. <BR><BR>In 2006 Mr. Blatchford was the chair of the <BR>Colorado River Management Work Group <BR>(CRMWG), a group of stakeholders that meet with <BR>Reclamation in satisfaction of the 1968 Project <BR>Act. The consultation process consists of <BR>mulitdisciplined individuals such as lawyers, <BR>planners, engineers, and water resource <BR>managers. Involvement in the CRMWG requires <BR>strong leadership and interpersonal skills. <BR><BR>Also as River Operations manager Mr. Blatchford <BR>worked with special projects, including the Minute <BR>301 modeling process in close coordination with <BR>the Mexican and US sections of the International <BR>Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC).<BR>Regional Water Resource Manager<BR>Harris & Associates<BR>Privately Held; 201-500 employees; Civil <BR>Engineering industry<BR>December 2002  July 2005 (2 years 8 months)<BR><BR>As Regional Water Resource Manager at Harris <BR>and Associates, Mr. Blatchford initiated, <BR>developed, planned, coordinated, and provided <BR>technical assistance for a watershed restoration <BR>project on the Pittman Wash, in Henderson, <BR>Nevada, called Project GREEN on behalf of the <BR>City of Henderson. Mr. Blatchford initiated, <BR>planned and coordinated grant applications <BR>through the State of Nevada, and won $300,000 <BR>in Question 1 grant monies for project trails and <BR>other recreational outdoor activities. He <BR>coordinated with the City of Henderson a series of <BR>public meetings designed to engage the local and <BR>scientific community. Mr. Blatchford coordinated <BR>and managed scientific work with Federal <BR>agencies, such as the EPA, the NRCS, and the <BR>NPS to address habitat restoration, surface water <BR>and groundwater issues related to the highly <BR>saline, shallow aquifer, the affect of tamarisk <BR>versus native species on the hydrologic cycle, and <BR>surface water hydraulic modeling. <BR><BR>Also as the Regional Water Resource Manager, <BR>Mr. Blatchford prepared and provided technical <BR>direction for the preparation of a Storm Water <BR>Pollution Prevention Plan for Madera County, <BR>California, as mandated by EPA's Phase II <BR>requirements for storm water discharge. <BR><BR>Mr. Blatchford also gave direction, and technical <BR>expertise to land related issues, such as parcel <BR>and tract boundaries and maps, easements, BLM <BR>patent easements, offers of dedications, fee title <BR>ownership of property, public land survey, all <BR>related to grading and drainage studies and plans <BR>reviewed on behalf of Clark County, Nevada. <BR><BR>Mr. Blatchford collaborated with UNLV and the <BR>Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology to map the <BR>Quaternary Geology of the Sloan Quadrangle. <BR>Duties included indentifying ancient surficial <BR>alluvial land forms from aerial photographs and <BR>field reviews, mapping alluvial surfaces based on <BR>digital orthophotographs, and research of alluvial <BR>processes and the origin of ancient alluvial <BR>surfaces in the desert southwest.<BR>Project Manager<BR>Carter-Burgess<BR>August 2000  December 2002 (2 years 5 <BR>months)<BR><BR>As Project Manager, Mr. Blatchford was <BR>responsible for design and construction as a <BR>licensed civil engineer in the states of Arizona, <BR>California, Nevada, and New Mexico. <BR><BR>Mr. Blatchford performed detailed steady and <BR>unsteady hydraulic HEC-RAS modeling of the <BR>Truckee River at the USA Parkway interchange <BR>for Storey County, including a detailed scour and <BR>fluvial geomorphological analysis. <BR><BR>Mr. Blatchford competed for and won the C-1 <BR>Channel Flood Insurance Study ReStudy (C-1 FIS <BR>Restudy) for the Clark County Regional Flood <BR>Control District (CCRFCD) on behalf of the City of <BR>Henderson. The study revised the exisitng Special <BR>Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) in the C-1 <BR>watershed reflecting existing channel and <BR>detention basin construction. <BR><BR>Mr. Blatchford processed and received approval <BR>of the permit for Winnick Drain modifications for <BR>the Imperial Palace Monorail station. A supporting <BR>column for the Imperial Palace Station was placed <BR>on the intake weir of Winnick Drain, changing how <BR>the weir functioned. The Winnick Drain intake weir <BR>was physically modeled at Reclamation's <BR>Technical Services Center in Denver, Colorado.<BR><BR>Oil and Gas Drilling and Logging<BR>Schlumberger<BR>Public Company; 10,001+ employees; <BR>NYSE:SLB; Oil & Energy industry<BR>February 1981  April 1982 (1 year 3 months) <BR>Alaska, California, Nevada<BR><BR>Industry experience drilling for oil and gas, and <BR>writing geologic drill logs.
