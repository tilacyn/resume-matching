I also trained fellow employees on <BR>how to best convince customers of products, <BR>programs, and training classes during my <BR>employment with Petco. My managers could <BR>always count on me to show new associates how <BR>to run the front of the store and give top notch <BR>customer service. <BR>Sales/Retail:  I expanded my ability to <BR>communicate better with people and earn their <BR>trust very quickly. I always gave the best advice <BR>when it came it pet care and customers knew to <BR>come looking for me when they had a question or <BR>problem.<BR><BR>Cashier/barista (soda tender)/hostess<BR>Dixie Cafe - Jonesboro, AR<BR>October 2005 to July 2009<BR>Responsibilities<BR>Greet guests, seat guests, run register,make <BR>desserts and drinks, answer<BR>telephone, run food, clean tables and carry out <BR>orders<BR><BR>Accomplishments<BR>I was the best hostess they ever had. I was <BR>excellent at dividing tables<BR>and predicting turn overs. I always worked peak <BR>shifts (busiest times<BR>such as Sundays and Mother's Day). I also <BR>produced the prettiest desserts<BR>and drinks because I had so much experience <BR>making them prior to my job<BR>at Dixie Cafe.<BR>I also trained every new hire how to properly host <BR>(meaning how to follow<BR>the seating chart while using their best <BR>judgement) and also how to give<BR>outstanding customer service.<BR>I was a highly valued member of their team until I <BR>had to quit to go to<BR>school full time.<BR><BR>Skills Used<BR>Top notch customer service- you will never meet <BR>a person nicer to guests<BR>than myself<BR>Leadership- I conducted all the seating <BR>arrangements and directed the<BR>servers and busboys where to go next.<BR>Barista skills-Prior to being a hostess, I spent my <BR>whole life making<BR>espresso drinks. I grew up in a home where <BR>coffee was important and we<BR>had our full size espresso machine, steamer and <BR>grinder. My parents<BR>taught me everything I know about coffee; it is a <BR>passion of ours. Three<BR>of those years prior to working at Dixie Cafe, I <BR>worked in two different<BR>coffee shops in the area.<BR>I have loads of experience up-selling cafe <BR>products such as pie, cookies,<BR>candy etc.<BR>I do very well as a multi-tasker as well. I can make <BR>drinks, greet guests<BR>and take orders all at once.<BR><BR>Barista<BR>Coffee Gallery/Club Tan - Jonesboro, AR<BR>May 2005 to October 2005<BR>Responsibilities<BR>Make espresso drinks, blended drinks, desserts <BR>(chocolates and fudge were<BR>something new I had to learn to make), answer <BR>drive thru window, run<BR>register, bus tables, clean tanning beds, restock <BR>supplies and shelve<BR>products.<BR><BR>Accomplishments<BR>I taught all of their new hires how to correctly <BR>make espresso drinks. I<BR>also trained new employees in proper customer <BR>service for greeting<BR>guests, answering phones, and polite small talk <BR>with guests while<BR>working.<BR><BR>Skills Used<BR>Coffee and dessert making- Like I said before, I <BR>have been making<BR>espresso ever since I can remember but my <BR>beautiful dessert creations are<BR>absolutely inspired by my time working at Coffee <BR>Gallery. My drinks and<BR>desserts are like masterpieces in the Cafe World.<BR>Register- This was a very fast paced environment <BR>that could get very<BR>hectic very quickly. I remember that my awesome <BR>register skills were<BR>really put to the test with that Drive Thru window <BR>they installed, but I<BR>have always been up for a challenge.<BR>Multi-tasking skills- I was running that register, <BR>answering phones,<BR>making drinks, preparing dessert ingredients, and <BR>cleaning tanning beds.<BR>There was never a dull moment nor was I ever <BR>standing idle behind that<BR>bar.<BR><BR>Receptionist<BR>Skyventure Aviation - Jonesboro, AR<BR>September 2003 to October 2005<BR>Responsibilities<BR>Greeted clients, answered the phones, offered <BR>drinks and snacks to<BR>clients, booked lessons and airplane rentals, <BR>produced invoices using<BR>Quickbooks, and handled payments.<BR><BR>Accomplishments<BR>This was my first job ever. I was 14 years old and <BR>a freshman in high<BR>school when I began working for my father part <BR>time as one of his<BR>receptionists at his newly opened flight school. I <BR>learned how to use all<BR>sorts of software including Quickbooks, <BR>WordPerfect, PowerPoint,<BR>Spreadsheet and Adobe. I also learned how to <BR>cashier, process credit card<BR>transactions, schedule appointments for others, <BR>and how to open and close<BR>a store alone.<BR><BR>Skills Used<BR>Customer service- I really stood out in the <BR>workplace because I was so<BR>young, so I learned to act older than I really was <BR>by demonstrating work<BR>ethic and customer service someone twice my <BR>age would have shown. I<BR>enjoyed impressing people with my sharp <BR>communication skills and<BR>conversation techniques.<BR>Computer skills- In high school it is a requirement <BR>to know how to use<BR>all of the software I listed above (with the <BR>exception of Quickbooks)<BR>before you start 10th grade. I found myself <BR>training the other employees<BR>and business partners how to use their own <BR>computers at work.<BR>This was a great learning experience for me when <BR>I was in high school.<BR><BR>Barista<BR>Cafe Java - Paragould, AR<BR>October 2004 to May 2005<BR>Responsibilities<BR>Prepare espresso drinks, blended drinks, <BR>desserts, and soups.<BR>Run register, answer phones, prepare gift <BR>baskets, and clean.<BR><BR>Accomplishments<BR>I trained new hires on how to correctly make <BR>espresso drinks and how to<BR>properly treat customers.<BR>I also planted and tended to their flowers they had <BR>in front of their<BR>store.<BR><BR>Skills Used<BR>Coffee and general cafe knowledge- I put my <BR>skills to the test here. This<BR>was my first real job outside of my dad's small <BR>business. I was<BR>introduced to the Cafe world at Cafe Java when I <BR>was 16 years old and a<BR>sophomore in high school. I walked away knowing <BR>how to run a register,<BR>how to communicate with customers and how to <BR>up-sell products.<BR>Education<BR>Major in Creative Writing<BR>University of Arkansas - Fayetteville, AR<BR>2010 to 2012<BR>Major in Business<BR>Arkansas State University - Jonesboro, AR<BR>2007 to 2012<BR><BR>Additional Information<BR>I am also a certified dog trainer and I spend pretty <BR>much all of my free time with animals. I have <BR>spent my whole with a variety of pets and I have <BR>always<BR>been in pet services on a small part time level. I <BR>have done volunteer<BR>work with a number of animal related <BR>organizations including some of the<BR>humane societies of the Fayetteville, AR area, Tri-<BR>lakes Humane societies<BR>of the Branson/Eureka Springs, AR area, and <BR>Gentle Souls Pit Bull Rescue<BR>of Harrisson, AR. Last year I raised over $9000 to <BR>support such causes<BR>and I intend to raise even more this year! I am <BR>extremely passionate<BR>about animal rescue to say the least. I also offer <BR>references to serious inquiries upon request. </FONT></FONT>
