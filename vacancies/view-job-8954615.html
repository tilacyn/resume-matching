No loans and no upfront costs. Simple as that.  <BR><BR>When you do land a great new job making over the salary threshold, we ask that you pay it forward and contribute a small portion of your post-program earnings so future learners can enjoy the same success that you did.  <BR><BR>Our core belief is that talented, ambitious adults should not have to face years of debt without guaranteed outcomes. We are so committed to our learners career outcomes that we bear the complete financial risk of educating learners. That is how much we believe in your ability to succeed.   <BR><BR>The Merit America Success Sharing Program enables working adults to get the skills employers want with a flexible education program, funded by a combination of 1) philanthropy, 2) employers, and 3) alumni who have successfully made career transitions following our program and pay it forward.<BR>How Does the Success Sharing Program Work?<BR>Learners participate in the Merit America program with absolutely no upfront costs or loans, and can even receive weekly stipends of $100/week to help cover any possible associated costs for their participation (e.g., transportation, childcare, foregone work hours, etc.). <BR><BR>Learners in the Junior Java Developer track who secure new jobs after the program with annual incomes of $50,000 ($4,166 a month) or more will make fixed monthly payments of $225 over the course of 24 months, with a maximum total contribution of $5,400.<BR><BR>If learners choose to receive the optional cost-of-living stipend of $1,500, learners will make 24  monthly payments of $288, for a total contribution of $6,900.<BR>Monthly payments pause when alumni are making below the income threshold. After 48 months, payment or no payment, the obligation ends.<BR>If a graduate fulfills our post program requirements and is not placed in a new job with an annual income of 50k or more within one year, the entire cost of the program is waived.<BR>100% of payments from learners go towards ensuring that future learners are able to participate in Merit America programs.<BR>If you have any questions about the Success Sharing Program, there will be numerous opportunities to discuss the program details throughout the admissions process.<BR>One last thing: Diversity is integral to our success and we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We believe that all workplaces should be truly inclusive of underrepresented individuals in terms of race, gender and/or socio-economic status, and any other characteristics protected by applicable law. We strongly encourage individuals from underrepresented groups to apply.</FONT></FONT>
